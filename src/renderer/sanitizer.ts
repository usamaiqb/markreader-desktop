 *  The sanitizer — and the only place in the renderer that writes document HTML into the DOM.
 *
 *  `engine.ts` runs markdown-it with `html: true`, because a Markdown reader that drops raw
 *  HTML is not much of a Markdown reader. Nothing filtered the result before this file
 *  existed, which meant a document could put whatever it liked into the page.
 *
 *  Both hosts need this, for different reasons. Desktop has the more capable attacker — the
 *  page can reach the `mdr:` scheme and the IPC bridge. Android needs it because option 3
 *  introduces script execution on untrusted document content, which the Markwon-based reader
 *  it replaces could not do at all. So the fix lives here, in shared code, rather than in
 *  either host.
 *
 *  This is the second layer, not the only one: the host page's CSP is the first, and it is
 *  what actually stops an inline `onerror` from running. A sanitizer that missed something
 *  and a CSP that missed something have to line up before anything executes.
